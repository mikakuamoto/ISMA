This file describes API changes in core filter API and plugins,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.2 ===

* legacy filters and legacy locations have been deprecated, so any
  old filter should be updated to use the new moodle_text_filter,
  and any filter bundled under mod/xxxx directories be moved to
  /filter/xxxx (MDL-29995). They will stop working completely in
  Moodle 2.3 (MDL-29996). See the glossary or data filters for
  examples of legacy module filters and locations already updated.
